Hi! My name is Amalyn Kaikko. 
I'm a freshman at Del Norte Highschool. This little blurb is mostly a test, because I can't for the life of me get VScode to work. 
![The Thai flag](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFlag_of_Thailand&psig=AOvVaw2Tt4_fzskfLAi6ZXR5w_gY&ust=1734122283231000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBQQjRxqFwoTCKD2-IaLo4oDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAQ)
An image test! If you can see the Thai flag, this worked! If you can't, I'm doing something wrong, and I will be sad.
