Hi! My name is Amalyn Kaikko.   
I'm a freshman at Del Norte Highschool. This little blurb is mostly a test, because I can't for the life of me get VScode to work.    

![Thai flag](https://cdn.britannica.com/38/4038-050-BDDBA6AB/Flag-Thailand.jpg){: style="width: 50%; height: auto;" }    
![Finnish flag](https://cdn.britannica.com/79/579-050-02C3366F/Flag-Finland.jpg){: style="width: 50%; height: auto;" }   

An image test! If you can see the flags, this worked! If you can't, I'm doing something wrong, and I will be sad.
