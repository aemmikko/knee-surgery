<h1>About Me</h1>
Hi! My name is Amalyn Kaikko. I'm a freshman at Del Norte Highschool. My mother is from Thailand and my father is from Finland. I was born in America, but I've visited both to see relatives.

<h2>Family</h2>
My family is just me, my mom, and my dad. I have no siblings, but we used to have two cats when I was younger. We love to travel, and we usually go to Finland to visit my grandparents during the summer. Unfortunately, the only person on my mom's side that I really know is my grandma (ยาย), but my uncle Juha and cousin Helmi live in Finland near my grandparents and whenever we vist we're sure to see them too!
